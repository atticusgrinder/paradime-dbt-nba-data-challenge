      This table contains detailed information (statistics) about individual NBA
      games (playoffs and regular season games) from 1946 - 2023. When examining
      the data you'll notice that the game_id appears twice (There are two
      columns containing the same game_id). One of those columns contains
      statistics from the home team, and the other column statistics from the
      away team. This data set comes from the official NBA API. Learn more at
      https://github.com/swar/nba_api.
