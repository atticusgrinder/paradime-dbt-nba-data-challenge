      This table contains non-statistical information about NBA teams per season
      from 1946 - 2023, including their founding year and location details. This
      teams data is current, meaning that only the team's current city and state
      is available. Example: There's no team called 'Seattle Supersonics'. 
      Instead, that team is called 'Oklahoma City Thunder' because that's where
      the team (indicated by the team_id) currently resides.

      This data set comes from the official NBA api. You can learn more here.
